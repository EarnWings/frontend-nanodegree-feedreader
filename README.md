# Feed Reader Project

This is a project completed as a part of obtaining a Udacity Nanodegree in Front End Web Design. The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Simply fork and clone this project, then run on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a github account. That's really about it, and even that is not required if you simply want to copy the files and load them manually on your computer.

### Installing

Load the files onto your computer, using the same file structure used in the project on my github account.

Run the index.html in a browser.

## Running the tests

The tests will automatically run, and their statuses will appear at the bottom of the index.html page.

## Built With

* [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) - A simple JavaScript testing framework
* [HTML]
* [CSS]
* [JavaScript]
* [jQuery]

## Contributing

This is a project created to work toward obtaining a nanodegree from Udacity, and therefore pull requests will be ignored.

## Acknowledgments

As always, my limited mental ability requires me to obtain lots of help, lots of the time. This time, I have to credit the following:

* Matthew Cranford ([blog] (https://matthewcranford.com/blog/)) had a pretty awesome walkthrough of this project, while still leaving some of it up to his readers to solve on their own. Thanks, Matthew!
* Ben Cunningham's ([YouTube] (https://youtu.be/_XwH-xfvydw)) video got me started on this project. Many thanks to Ben as well for putting himself out there in hopes of helping others. You certainly helped me!
